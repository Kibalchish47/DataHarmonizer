# DataHarmonizer
DataHarmonizer (Professorâ€™s Spreadsheet Standardizer) is a Python program designed to streamline administrative tasks for college professors. When professors receive diverse Excel spreadsheets containing student data (such as grades, attendance, or assignments), this program automatically standardizes the data into a consistent template. By identifying common columns and creating uniform spreadsheets, it simplifies subsequent data analysis.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to empower professors with a hands-off solution. Professors can simply place their spreadsheets in the designated input folder, run the program, and obtain standardized output files. This consistency not only facilitates data analysis but also reduces the risk of errors or discrepancies. Whether dealing with column-based or row-based spreadsheets, the DataHarmonizer (Professorâ€™s Spreadsheet Standardizer) ensures efficiency and accuracy in administrative workflows.
