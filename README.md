# DataHarmonizer
This project's goal is to help college professors (and other people!) to deal with large spreadsheets, specifically with grades, by automating the standardization of said spreadsheets and basic data analysis. 

By "standardization", I mean that the program takes several spreadsheets (as .csv files) and outputs spreadsheets with the same data and the same layout to make further data analysis trivial.
